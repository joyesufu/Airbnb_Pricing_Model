# Project_4

## Background:

You probably have heard many success stories regarding people making a substantial amount of money posting their properties on Airbnb. To test the accuracy of these claims a machine learning model has been created to test whether or not the prices that are listed for Airbnbs are properly priced. Some of the property types that are being analyzed include: homes, apartments, hotels, etc. For this project different features will be analyzed to see whether or not they have either a positive, negative, or no affect on the price of the listing. New York City will be the topic of this particular project. The source of the data used for this project comes from Inside Airbnb.
